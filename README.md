Air Passenger Time Series Forecasting with ARIMA

This project focuses on forecasting airline passenger traffic using the Air Passenger Data, a popular time series dataset. The dataset contains monthly international airline passenger totals from 1949 to 1960, showcasing clear trends and seasonality.

In this repository, we apply the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model to predict future passenger numbers. ARIMA is a robust forecasting method that can model both the trend and seasonality in time series data. The key steps covered in this project include:

* Data exploration and visualization to understand the patterns and trends.
* Preprocessing and preparing the data for ARIMA modeling.
* Building and tuning the ARIMA model for accurate forecasting.
* Evaluating model performance using metrics such as MAE and RMSE.

This project demonstrates how time series forecasting can be applied in real-world scenarios, like predicting airline passenger demand, improving scheduling, and optimizing operations.
